# Base Learn – Base Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through Base Learn,
starting with my first smart contract deployment on Base testnet
and progressing through Solidity fundamentals.

## Timeline
1. Smart contract deployment on Base Sepolia (first on-chain interaction with Base sepolia)
2. Control Structures
3. Loops
4. Arrays
5. Mappings

## Tooling
- Solidity
- Remix IDE
- Base Sepolia
- Foundry (later modules)

## On-chain Proof
All contracts are deployed on Base Sepolia.
Transaction hashes and contract addresses are documented per module.
